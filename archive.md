# Initial Reassessment
As described in RFC, in early 2000's, the Internet Protocol suite was studied and found not suitable for deep space. However, in 2022, a new assessment found that with the new IP stack features, IP is suitable for deep space networking. This reassessment is discussed in this [IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-many-deepspace-ip-assessment/). This reassessment was the foundation of this initiative, which led into the creation of a new [IETF working group named tiptop](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tiptop/about/), which stands for "Taking IP to Other Planets".
